# Coordinator wave log

## Wave 1

- K1 crafting data merged. Notes for K4: item fields `a: [[affixId,q]]`, `mw`, `rf` (Focus `f` dropped).
  Haste per point (0.05% cd) looks too small vs the trinket base line; tune in sim. `gainSkill`
  unlock message in 50-sim.js is hard-wired to ore/wood (K5). Tonic Mending Draught needs a `heal`
  modifier key (Stage C).
- K2 crafting icons merged (12x12, `iconURL(...craftIcon(name,t))`), gather node rigs `node:crystal|fibre|herb`.
  Renamed K2's `CRAFT_NODES` to `CRAFT_NODE_RIGS` (clash with K1). Polish later: `mat_fibre` reads as a
  bone, `mat_hide` a little turtle-like.
- Q1 away report + Journal merged. New systems add offline lines via `on('away', r => ...)` or
  `registerAwayLine(r => {icon, txt, sub})`. `S.stats` added. Tavern "Lifetime" block moved to the
  Journal (local stats only; no online code touched). Journal sits 3rd in World: consider a shortcut.
- B6 merged: rigs for all 18 companions, `STORIES`, `BIOS`, `JOIN_LINES`, `QUOTES`, `RARITY_FRAME` in
  21-stories.js; preview prototypes/roster.html. Grenna/Anselm/Vesper wield maul/handbell/lute as their
  role weapons (brief wins over the generic shield/tome rule). Polish backlog: shared skin ramp shades
  faces very red at 1x; Vesper's lute body hidden; Corvin needs more bone-white.

## Art direction reset (owner feedback, 2026-09-27)

Owner dislikes the current character art: "too thin and tall", clothing/armour "doesn't feel right",
maybe the overall style. Art work is paused. A style study (A chibi ~3 heads, B 16-bit JRPG ~4-4.5,
C sturdy storybook ~5, D art director's wildcard) with redesigned layered costumes goes to the owner
as a phone-viewable page; the pick then drives a conversion wave. Logic work is unaffected.
