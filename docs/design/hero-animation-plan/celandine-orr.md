# Celandine Orr: complete animation proposal

Planning only. stationary focus spell; basic Attack type: holy. Expanded cards/equipment remain proposals; concept approval is not pose approval.

**Count:** 131 distinct body poses; 205 body timeline keys across 34 sequences; 269 distinct separate FX frames across 33 FX sequences. Nine active signatures + three passives + five active class tools + one class passive. Passives require zero activation poses/actions.

Concept identity: `art/concepts/hero-candidates-v1/celandine-orr.png` (SHA256 `c8b20dd4bd3c7302b6e1c01cdd353d5d19dd2ba4b078385d1a488b24ccecf129`). Remaining registry notes: none. Keep the signed-off whole design; profile notes below explain kit intent and never override the approved pixels.

Celandine studied wounds by lamplight after the battle surgeons left. She now seeks the source of the dark that keeps opening old scars.

Equipment: Staff + anatomical tome.
Motion identity: precise lamplit anatomical gesture; fingers read supported pages without a new instrument.

No staff/sword/bow teleport, hand switch, disappearing shield, or midair tome. The same grip carries ready→windup→charge→release→recovery. Worn lantern remains present in every frame, including fallen and camp.
Two-handed weapons use both hands during contact. Preparation props remain supported/stowed; a free hand may gesture only with weapon butt grounded or weapon secured. Equipment compatibility remains the source proposal.
strict pixel grid, one-pixel dark outline, flat shade clusters, intact costume; cloth lag follows torso with one reversal then settles. Preserve source head, face, scale, palette and original left/right attachments.

Numerical wrist/focus/waist sockets must be measured from each future locked pose, recorded alongside pose IDs, and reviewed against its concept. No invented coordinates asserted from an unbuilt pose.

## Core, anchors and transitions

Authored facing right. Local body canvas 224×192, foot anchor (96,132); actual boots end on row 131. Root motion is separate. Grip/focus/offhand/tome/lantern sockets move with the actual pose; keep the original concept side and supported attachments. No compulsory walk, jump or staff teleport. No new gameplay from motion.

Spell/bow attacks stay at rootX=0. Manual Dodge has a small 0→−12→−6→0 lean. Pip and other casters have no required walking pose. Interruption/death latch the current world position.

Interruption return contract: {"eligibility": "alive and movement requires returning; never on death", "worldRootFormula": "originalWorldX + remainingFraction * (latchedWorldX - originalWorldX)", "localAnchor": [96, 132], "frames": [{"pose": "celandine-orr--dodge-recover", "remainingFraction": 1, "durationMs": 80}, {"pose": "celandine-orr--dodge-recover", "remainingFraction": 0.5, "durationMs": 90}, {"pose": "celandine-orr--ready", "remainingFraction": 0, "durationMs": 100}], "stationaryCase": "latchedWorldX equals originalWorldX, so every evaluated root remains at origin; no dash ID required", "death": "do not invoke; retain latchedWorldX for kneel/fall/fallen"}

Core mappings: Attack → `motion-c`, Parry → `parry`, Dodge → `dodge`, Counter → `counter`, Idle → `idle`, Hurt → `hurt`, Death → `death`, Victory → `victory`, Camp → `camp`, Interruption → `interruption-blend`

Timing values below are presentation targets. Charged wind-ups hold 80–700ms for one ring/grade, then commit release and recoil/recovery. Hold time adds no pose. Reduced motion preserves event order and static state glyphs; do not retune input windows.

All four actions run at every eligible live node without any tool. Crafted Pickaxe/Woodaxe/Sickle/Hunting Spear improves speed only. Bare-hand mining prises loose stone, wood gathers loose branches, forage plucks, hunting reads tracks/collects hide; no unarmed combat or extra foe art. Combat axe/spear is not silently a gathering tool.

For each gathering job: `stow-combat` → job equip (if tool) → tool loop or hand loop → job stow (if tool) → `retrieve-combat`. Camp uses the same visible combat stow/retrieve. Each tool has separate four-key draw and four-key put-away; no popping tool or unarmed combat.

## Separate FX sheets: exact frame descriptions

Each layer is artist-authored matching pixel art. Wide impact, arrows and status contours never shrink the body. The source card above remains authoritative: a mentioned prerequisite/consumed status is never silently a new application.

### `fx-core-attack-and-counter` — Core Attack and Counter

16 distinct FX frames. No-token baseline uses action keys only. Retain mode leaves existing glyph intact. Spend/cancel mode contracts the exact selected source before contact. Recovery-only branches fold toward hero. Control attempt uses one burst; rejection fizzles with no success glyph. These modes are visual choices, never additional actions. timed charge peak synchronizes to body hold 80–700ms; untimed charge keys pass once without ring/input delay. Flight keys loop until arrival only. Finite state middle frame holds only to exact source expiry. Repeats do not increase distinct frame count.
body earned release begins projectile flight; projectile arrival (impact key 1) resolves printed contact exactly once. Held melee resolves at body contact. Pure preparation applies only at its application key. Timed paths grade once before release; untimed paths bypass input and pass charge keys continuously without a ring hold.
Independent layer tracks: charge → `fx-core-attack-and-counter-charge-1`,`fx-core-attack-and-counter-charge-2`,`fx-core-attack-and-counter-charge-3`,`fx-core-attack-and-counter-charge-4` (body wind-up begins → body earned release key; untimed actions pass through these keys once without ring or held wait); release → `fx-core-attack-and-counter-release-1`,`fx-core-attack-and-counter-release-2` (body release key only, after grade if timed → projectile flight begins; no foe contact yet); flight → `fx-core-attack-and-counter-flight-1`,`fx-core-attack-and-counter-flight-2`,`fx-core-attack-and-counter-flight-3`,`fx-core-attack-and-counter-flight-4` (release layer clears held focus → one confirmed arrival); impact → `fx-core-attack-and-counter-impact-1`,`fx-core-attack-and-counter-impact-2`,`fx-core-attack-and-counter-impact-3`,`fx-core-attack-and-counter-impact-4`,`fx-core-attack-and-counter-impact-5`,`fx-core-attack-and-counter-impact-6` (projectile arrival, not body wind-up → impact key 6 clears; no independent second proc budget). Shared frame IDs reference the counted reusable module/state sheet.

| FX frame ID | Drawing and phase | Hold ms | Socket |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `fx-core-attack-and-counter-charge-1` | One compact 3-cluster seed of one compact the dawn surgeon focus ray appears at the attached release socket; outer silhouette stays dark and body stays readable | 90 | focusRelease or pointed held-weapon tip |
| `fx-core-attack-and-counter-charge-2` | one compact the dawn surgeon focus ray: seed doubles its apparent width by filling the adjacent shade clusters; two short contour arcs curl inward, never detach yet | 140 | focusRelease or pointed held-weapon tip |
| `fx-core-attack-and-counter-charge-3` | one compact the dawn surgeon focus ray: charged core fills the centre with the lightest source-palette cluster; outer lobes stretch along the target axis while hands visibly brace | 170 | focusRelease or pointed held-weapon tip |
| `fx-core-attack-and-counter-charge-4` | one compact the dawn surgeon focus ray: peak form is held still; corona closes into a coherent rim rather than random sparks; only the inner two shade clusters shift once | 260 | focusRelease or pointed held-weapon tip |
| `fx-core-attack-and-counter-release-1` | one compact the dawn surgeon focus ray: front contour separates from the release socket; bright kernel elongates toward the single target, rear contour remains at the held focus/string for this key | 55 | focus/string release socket |
| `fx-core-attack-and-counter-release-2` | one compact the dawn surgeon focus ray: front clears the hand/weapon completely; rear contour pulls into a long tapered tail; held weapon stays fully drawn on body sheet | 65 | focus/string release socket |
| `fx-core-attack-and-counter-flight-1` | one compact the dawn surgeon focus ray: coherent leading shape and long tapered tail leave the hero; widest lobe stays behind the bright kernel | 70 | projectile-local kernel origin; translate to existing foe socket |
| `fx-core-attack-and-counter-flight-2` | one compact the dawn surgeon focus ray: tail bows one cluster away from the body side while the kernel keeps a stable centre; no shape break into new actors | 70 | projectile-local kernel origin; translate to existing foe socket |
| `fx-core-attack-and-counter-flight-3` | one compact the dawn surgeon focus ray: bright centre narrows, rear tail stretches and two small terminal clusters separate as light only | 70 | projectile-local kernel origin; translate to existing foe socket |
| `fx-core-attack-and-counter-flight-4` | one compact the dawn surgeon focus ray: terminal clusters rejoin the tail silhouette for a seamless four-key travel loop, kernel orientation unchanged | 70 | projectile-local kernel origin; translate to existing foe socket |
| `fx-core-attack-and-counter-impact-1` | one compact the dawn surgeon focus ray: leading tip/kernel meets the current foe socket; flatten one cluster along the contact plane; authorize printed contact/application once here | 55 | existing foe impact socket; self-only side effects resolve separately at hero contour |
| `fx-core-attack-and-counter-impact-2` | one compact the dawn surgeon focus ray: compressed core opens into two lateral lobes; source-colour rim marks the exact hit plane without covering the hero | 70 | existing foe impact socket; self-only side effects resolve separately at hero contour |
| `fx-core-attack-and-counter-impact-3` | one compact the dawn surgeon focus ray: impact reaches its widest authored silhouette, with a bright central cross-cluster and dark edge; powerful releases earn this peak after charge | 100 | existing foe impact socket; self-only side effects resolve separately at hero contour |
| `fx-core-attack-and-counter-impact-4` | one compact the dawn surgeon focus ray: central light retracts; outer lobes split into four large coherent shade clusters, never extra hits or actors | 90 | existing foe impact socket; self-only side effects resolve separately at hero contour |
| `fx-core-attack-and-counter-impact-5` | one compact the dawn surgeon focus ray: four outer clusters thin to two low-brightness fragments; any confirmed finite status remains in its own pooled overlay | 100 | existing foe impact socket; self-only side effects resolve separately at hero contour |
| `fx-core-attack-and-counter-impact-6` | one compact the dawn surgeon focus ray: last two fragments contract and clear to transparent; no looping explosion or repeated damage | 140 | existing foe impact socket; self-only side effects resolve separately at hero contour |

### `fx-clean-incision` — Clean Incision

16 distinct FX frames. Single printed route. Use only the confirmed application layer; references to cleanup/limits are not status creation. timed charge peak synchronizes to body hold 80–700ms; untimed charge keys pass once without ring/input delay. Flight keys loop until arrival only. Finite state middle frame holds only to exact source expiry. Repeats do not increase distinct frame count.
body earned release begins projectile flight; projectile arrival (impact key 1) resolves printed contact exactly once. Held melee resolves at body contact. Pure preparation applies only at its application key. Timed paths grade once before release; untimed paths bypass input and pass charge keys continuously without a ring hold.
Independent layer tracks: charge → `fx-clean-incision-charge-1`,`fx-clean-incision-charge-2`,`fx-clean-incision-charge-3`,`fx-clean-incision-charge-4` (body wind-up begins → body earned release key; untimed actions pass through these keys once without ring or held wait); release → `fx-clean-incision-release-1`,`fx-clean-incision-release-2` (body release key only, after grade if timed → projectile flight begins; no foe contact yet); flight → `fx-clean-incision-flight-1`,`fx-clean-incision-flight-2`,`fx-clean-incision-flight-3`,`fx-clean-incision-flight-4` (release layer clears held focus → one confirmed arrival); impact → `fx-clean-incision-impact-1`,`fx-clean-incision-impact-2`,`fx-clean-incision-impact-3`,`fx-clean-incision-impact-4`,`fx-clean-incision-impact-5`,`fx-clean-incision-impact-6` (projectile arrival, not body wind-up → impact key 6 clears; no independent second proc budget). Shared frame IDs reference the counted reusable module/state sheet.

### `fx-state-ward` — Reusable Ward state

3 distinct FX frames. Application expands, consumption contracts, retain holds unchanged; control rejection clears immediately. Shared drawing keys, not shared gameplay sources. static middle frame until the exact source expiry
confirmed source resolution only

| FX frame ID | Drawing and phase | Hold ms | Socket |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `fx-state-ward-1` | Ward: existing glyph brightens once on confirmed printed application; on consumption it contracts instead, on retained branch it stays unchanged; no glyph if this card only references an absent prerequisite | 120 | hero contour |

### `fx-sterile-field` — Sterile Field

6 distinct FX frames. No-token baseline uses action keys only. Retain mode leaves existing glyph intact. Spend/cancel mode contracts the exact selected source before contact. Recovery-only branches fold toward hero. Control attempt uses one burst; rejection fizzles with no success glyph. These modes are visual choices, never additional actions. timed charge peak synchronizes to body hold 80–700ms; untimed charge keys pass once without ring/input delay. Flight keys loop until arrival only. Finite state middle frame holds only to exact source expiry. Repeats do not increase distinct frame count.
body earned release begins projectile flight; projectile arrival (impact key 1) resolves printed contact exactly once. Held melee resolves at body contact. Pure preparation applies only at its application key. Timed paths grade once before release; untimed paths bypass input and pass charge keys continuously without a ring hold.

### `fx-state-curse` — Reusable Curse state

3 distinct FX frames. Application expands, consumption contracts, retain holds unchanged; control rejection clears immediately. Shared drawing keys, not shared gameplay sources. static middle frame until the exact source expiry
confirmed source resolution only

| FX frame ID | Drawing and phase | Hold ms | Socket |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `fx-state-curse-1` | Curse: existing glyph brightens once on confirmed printed application; on consumption it contracts instead, on retained branch it stays unchanged; no glyph if this card only references an absent prerequisite | 120 | existing affected hero/foe status socket as selected by the printed clause |

### `fx-hex` — Hex

16 distinct FX frames. No-token baseline uses action keys only. Retain mode leaves existing glyph intact. Spend/cancel mode contracts the exact selected source before contact. Recovery-only branches fold toward hero. Control attempt uses one burst; rejection fizzles with no success glyph. These modes are visual choices, never additional actions. timed charge peak synchronizes to body hold 80–700ms; untimed charge keys pass once without ring/input delay. Flight keys loop until arrival only. Finite state middle frame holds only to exact source expiry. Repeats do not increase distinct frame count.
body earned release begins projectile flight; projectile arrival (impact key 1) resolves printed contact exactly once. Held melee resolves at body contact. Pure preparation applies only at its application key. Timed paths grade once before release; untimed paths bypass input and pass charge keys continuously without a ring hold.
Use the same resolution FX key when the exact scheduled/stored event fires, at the recorded foe/self socket; no second cast body action. Clear source before any derived payout; death/fight cleanup follows source. Scheduled arrival is not counted as another activation.
Independent layer tracks: charge → `fx-hex-charge-1`,`fx-hex-charge-2`,`fx-hex-charge-3`,`fx-hex-charge-4` (body wind-up begins → body earned release key; untimed actions pass through these keys once without ring or held wait); release → `fx-hex-release-1`,`fx-hex-release-2` (body release key only, after grade if timed → projectile flight begins; no foe contact yet); flight → `fx-hex-flight-1`,`fx-hex-flight-2`,`fx-hex-flight-3`,`fx-hex-flight-4` (release layer clears held focus → one confirmed arrival); impact → `fx-hex-impact-1`,`fx-hex-impact-2`,`fx-hex-impact-3`,`fx-hex-impact-4`,`fx-hex-impact-5`,`fx-hex-impact-6` (projectile arrival, not body wind-up → impact key 6 clears; no independent second proc budget); Curse → `fx-state-curse-1`,`fx-state-curse-2`,`fx-state-curse-3` (only a confirmed printed Curse application, consumption, retention or expiry → source eligibility ends; creation does not reset unrelated states). Shared frame IDs reference the counted reusable module/state sheet.

| `fx-gather-woodcutting-self-preparation-2` | two wood chips separate from the existing node at contact; loose-branch fallback uses a dust fleck: contour opens halfway around the self/preparation socket as the hand or held shield/weapon moves inward | 140 | hero self contour or exact supported preparation socket |
| `fx-gather-woodcutting-self-preparation-3` | two wood chips separate from the existing node at contact; loose-branch fallback uses a dust fleck: contour closes into a small coherent rim; dark edge and bright centre remain separate from face and equipment | 180 | hero self contour or exact supported preparation socket |
| `fx-gather-woodcutting-self-preparation-4` | two wood chips separate from the existing node at contact; loose-branch fallback uses a dust fleck: selected preparation/protection/recovery applies once; rim fills inward rather than firing a projectile | 80 | hero self contour or exact supported preparation socket |
| `fx-gather-woodcutting-self-preparation-5` | two wood chips separate from the existing node at contact; loose-branch fallback uses a dust fleck: broad rim narrows into two attached source-colour notches; any real held state transfers to its finite overlay | 130 | hero self contour or exact supported preparation socket |
| `fx-gather-woodcutting-self-preparation-6` | two wood chips separate from the existing node at contact; loose-branch fallback uses a dust fleck: residual notches fade to transparent as equipment visibly returns to ready | 180 | hero self contour or exact supported preparation socket |

### `fx-gather-foraging` — Gather foraging

6 distinct FX frames. No-token baseline uses action keys only. Retain mode leaves existing glyph intact. Spend/cancel mode contracts the exact selected source before contact. Recovery-only branches fold toward hero. Control attempt uses one burst; rejection fizzles with no success glyph. These modes are visual choices, never additional actions. timed charge peak synchronizes to body hold 80–700ms; untimed charge keys pass once without ring/input delay. Flight keys loop until arrival only. Finite state middle frame holds only to exact source expiry. Repeats do not increase distinct frame count.
body earned release begins projectile flight; projectile arrival (impact key 1) resolves printed contact exactly once. Held melee resolves at body contact. Pure preparation applies only at its application key. Timed paths grade once before release; untimed paths bypass input and pass charge keys continuously without a ring hold.
Independent layer tracks: self-preparation → `fx-gather-foraging-self-preparation-1`,`fx-gather-foraging-self-preparation-2`,`fx-gather-foraging-self-preparation-3`,`fx-gather-foraging-self-preparation-4`,`fx-gather-foraging-self-preparation-5`,`fx-gather-foraging-self-preparation-6` (selected action wind-up, no offensive contact → recovery complete; only exact authored state remains). Shared frame IDs reference the counted reusable module/state sheet.
